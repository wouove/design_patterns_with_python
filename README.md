Coding exercises that come with pluralsight's Design Patterns with Python

#SOLID object oriented programming principles
**S**: Single responsibility \
**O**: Open/Closed. Class should be open to extension (by inheretance), but closed for modification \
**L**: Liskov substitution principle. \
**I**: Interface segregation principle. Many different interfaces are better than "One to rule them all" \
**D**: dependency inversion principle. Depend upon abstractions, not on implementations

# 1 Strategy pattern
- Encapsulate algorithms
- Several techniques available
- Red flag: sequences of if/elif statements
